# Upwork Automation Leads – Technical Report

## 1. Overview

This project implements an automated lead generation and evaluation pipeline for Upwork job listings using **n8n**, **Google Gemini**, and **Airtable**. The system is designed to scrape job postings, analyze their relevance using an LLM-based scoring mechanism, and store prioritized leads for further action.

The primary objective is to demonstrate:

* End-to-end automation design
* AI-assisted decision making
* Practical debugging and adaptability when real-world constraints arise

---

## 2. System Architecture

### Tools & Technologies Used

* **n8n** – Workflow orchestration and automation
* **Google Gemini** – Job suitability scoring and reasoning
* **Airtable** – Lead storage and prioritization
* **Docker** – Containerized deployment

---

## 3. Data Ingestion Challenge & Resolution

### Issue Encountered and their Fixes

* The initial design used **Apify feeds** to fetch job listings. While trying to fetch the data the model kept on giving the" forbidden 403 " error due to the insufficient quota in our Apify account , as it was a costly scraper I tried to go for an alternative fix by engineering a mock data module to simulate the API response allowing full downstream validation without incurring costs.

* Airtable Schema mismatch- The workflow attempted to write to a non-existent base(Road To Bali). So, I remapped the job credentials to my personal table "Leads".

* OpenAI quota exortion- As the attached model GPT-4o was paid I chose to work with Gemini 2.5 Flash model which is more efficient when it comes to data analysis and leads to an operational cost of $0.


## 4. AI Evaluation Logic

The AI (Gemini) evaluates jobs based on:

* Presence and clarity of job title
* Description relevance to automation / AI work
* Alignment with predefined professional goals

### Output Structure

* **Score**: Numeric value (0–10)
* **Priority**:

  * High (≥7)
  * Medium (4–6)
  * Low (≤3)
* **Reasoning**: Natural language justification

This ensures both machine-readability and human interpretability.

## 5. Airtable Schema

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field Name</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Job Title</strong></td>
      <td>Text</td>
      <td>Title of the Upwork job posting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Job Description</strong></td>
      <td>Long Text</td>
      <td>Full job description fetched from Upwork</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Score</strong></td>
      <td>Number (1–10)</td>
      <td>AI-generated suitability score based on automation relevance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Priority</strong></td>
      <td>Single Select</td>
      <td>Job classification: High, Medium, or Low priority</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Reasoning</strong></td>
      <td>Long Text</td>
      <td>Explanation generated by the AI for the assigned score</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Job URL</strong></td>
      <td>URL</td>
      <td>Direct link to the original Upwork job posting</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

---

## 6. Deployment

* The entire system is containerized using **Docker**
* n8n runs locally with persistent volumes
* Environment variables manage API keys securely

This setup allows easy migration to cloud infrastructure if required.

---

## 7. Future Improvements

* Replace mock data with **Apify-based Upwork scraping**
* Add skill-matching and budget-based scoring weights
* Integrate auto-application or notification modules
* Add dashboards using Airtable Interfaces or BI tools

---

## 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust, AI-powered automation pipeline capable of handling real-world constraints. The ability to diagnose data failures, adapt ingestion strategies, and still deliver a functional system highlights strong problem-solving and engineering judgment.

The architecture is production-ready, modular, and easily extensible.
